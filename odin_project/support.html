            <h3>How will my money be used?</h3>
            <p>
              Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin
              Project. This includes paying for the servers that host the
              website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with
              running the project. Your money does not go towards paying the
              maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on the
              <a href="#">Open Collective Website</a>.

            <h3>How can I donate?</h3>
            <p>
              You can donate via <a href="#">Open Collective</a> , by setting up
              a recurring donation or with a one time payment.

            <h3>What form of payments can I use?</h3>
            <p>
              You can usually pay by credit card through our Open Collective
              page. They also offer bank transfer, Paypal, or other means in
              addition to or instead of credit card payments. When you go
              through the contribution flow, you'll see all the available
              payment methods.

              Any extra money that we receive will be used to improve The Odin
              Project, or will be saved for future needs. This includes paying
              for new features, paying for new servers, and paying for any other
              costs associated with running the project.

              Open Collective profile.

              completely free coding curriculum for anyone and everyone eager to
              learn. We believe that this material should be available for free
              to anyone that needs it, and donations from those that have the
              means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!

              In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our

            <h3>How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h3>
            <p>
              Use the /opencollective command in our discord server to verify
              your Open Collective account. You will then be automatically given
              the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your Open
              Collective username, which is found in the URL of your Open
              Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is
              https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is
              rick-astley.

              If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on

            <h3>What ever happend to Thinkful? Viking Code School?</h3>
            <p>
              When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was
              primarily funded by Eric's other project, the for-profit Viking
              Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by
              placing a small ad for Viking Code School on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a
              part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to continue funding The
              Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but
              supportive, and continued funding us the entire time. However we
              began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become
              self-funding, to avoid the risk of being acquired by a company
              that might not be as supportive.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with
              Chegg, and become self-funding. We are now funded entirely by
              donations.
