            <p class="content2">The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>

                <p class="origin_first_para">The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects. </p>
                <p class="origin_second_para">Erik Trautman founded The Odin Project in 2013. Currently it is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers many of whom learned to code with us. Many find success from Odin Project's curriculum because of its hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date.</p>

This also extends to the curriculum itself, anyone can work on new lessons, add new resources and improve existing lessons.</p>
